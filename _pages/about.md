I am a Graduate student pursuing a Business Analytics degree at the University of Louisville. I also graduated from Liberty University with Bachelor's degrees in Finance and Economics in May 2018. Most of my experience throughout the years are in market research, analytics, and financial management.

By the time I graduate from UofL in September 2020, I will have a decent knowledge of several high in-demand programming languages (Python, R, SQL...) for analytics, data mining and visualization (Tableau, Power BI...), storytelling with data, correlation and regression analysis, ect. With those skill sets under my belt, I hope to pursue an Analyst career where I can provide data-driven insights, managerial strategies, and clear communication to make practical and concrete decision for a company.
