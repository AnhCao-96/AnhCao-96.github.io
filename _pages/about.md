I am a Graduate student pursuing a Business Analytics degree at the University of Louisville. I also graduated from Liberty University with Bachelor's degrees in Finance and Economics in May 2018. Most of my experience throughout the years are in market research, analytics, and financial management.

My competencies by the time I graduate from UofL in September 2020:
- High in-demand programming languages: Python, R, SQL
- Data mining, wrangling, storytelling with data
- Statistical programs: SAS Studio, SPSS, Excel
- Statistical analysis: Simple and multiple linear regression, Two-Stage Least Squares, Difference in Difference, Propensity Score Matching, Heckman model, etc.
- Data visualization: Tableau, Power BI, R, Python
- Machine Learning modeling: SAS Enterprise Miner, etc.

With those skill sets under my belt, I am actively seeking a data analytics role where I can provide data-driven insights, managerial strategies, and clear communication to make practical and concrete decisions for the company.

Honored to serve as the first current student for the newsletter to prospective students at UofL.
