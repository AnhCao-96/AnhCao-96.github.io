I graduated from Liberty University with BS degrees in Finance and Economics in May 2018. I am currently pursuing a Master in Business Analytics at the University of Louisville in Fall 2019. Most of my experiences throughout the years are in market research, analytics, and financial management.

By the time I graduate from UofL in September 2020, I will have a decent knowledge of several high in-demand programming languages (Python, R, SQL...) for analytics, data mining and visualization, storytelling with data, correlation and regression analysis, ect. With those skill sets under my belt, I hope to pursue an Analyst career where I can provide data-driven insights, managerial strategies, and clear communication to make practical and concrete decision for a company.
